# Releasenotes rexplorer v0.2.0

Third pre-release of `rexplorer`: second minor version with breaking changes and
improvements of last pre-release (`v0.1.2`).

## Summary

- support protobuf as an encoding format for public data (making it an option alongside the already supported JSON and MessagePack);
- make the JSON and MessagePack encoding much more efficient in terms of stored space as well as speed;
- delete nil wallets (wallets which have no content to store any longer, e.g. because of completely reverted or spend, with no references to any MultiSig wallet);
- keep optionally track of unlocked outputs in wallet values if its description matches
  one of the description filters (glob patterns) given by the user as a CLI flag when starting the `rexplorer` binary;
- support Python 3 in the form of a sum coin integration test, ensuring that public data written by the `rexplorer` binary,
  in any of the rexplorer-available encoding formats, into Redis can be read by other programming languages (but Python 3 in specific)
  using a "standard" library;
- expand and improve README documentation;
- align the Redis flags naming convention of tools, examples and tests with the flags defined in the `rexplorer` binary;
- support new tfchain transaction versions:
  - coin creation transactions are tracked as a separate counter and its miner fees and outputs are also added to the total coin count;
  - coin creator definition transactions are tracked as a separate counter and its miner fees are also added to the total coin count;
- make internal storage a text-binary hybrid and much more efficient as a consequence;
- fix bug: cancelled context stops app now;
- add statistics on the different supported encoding formats within the context of the tfchain testnet;
- switch to Go 1.11 as the main (and recommended) Golang target;
- add travis CI checks to ensure that all examples and tools can be built using the two last Golang versions;
