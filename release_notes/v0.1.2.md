# Releasenotes rexplorer v0.1.2

Second pre-release of `rexplorer`: an improved version of the first pre-release version (`v0.1.1`),
using feedback from the Stakeholder as motivation and inspiration for improvements.

## Summary

- drop the network identifiers as prefixes to keys:
  - this limits the amount of networks that can be stored on a single Redis db to 1
  - network collisions (as in storing multiple networks in a single db)
    are detected and prevented while starting the rexplorer
- ensure the rexplorer can be quit gracefully, without the risk of stopping
  the process in the middle of a processed consensus change
- simplify the data format of an address, keeping all (public) info for that address
  in a single data structure
- support MessagePack encoding and using it as the default encoding type
  - JSON encoding can still be used, and it is to be activated using the `--encoding json` flag
- add support for pprof profiling over an HTTP interface (using the `--profile-addr <addr>` flag)
- add support for Travis CI integration
