# Releasenotes rexplorer v0.2.1

Fourth pre-release of `rexplorer`: improvements of last pre-release (`v0.2.0`).

## Summary

- improve integration tests: maximize integration test coverage and improve their performance;
- update out-of-date flag usage messages of examples and integration tests;
- fix bug: do not apply locked outputs on height 0;
- allow description filters (used to decide if an unlocked output should be stored within a wallet or not)
  to be changed for an existing redis db, without having to wipe the entire db first (saving the user minutes of time,
  as this new process only takes seconds, while repopulating the entire db can take minutes).
