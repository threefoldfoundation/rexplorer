# Faucet

A faucet makes it easy for developers to to obtain some tokens to test with.

Off course, this is only ran on testnet or a devnet.

The faucet does not create any tokens, it simply talks to a local daemon with a funded wallet to authorize an address or to send some tokens to the requested address.

Besides using the website, the [api](./doc/api.md) can also be called directly.
